Topic: Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Q1) Identify FRs and NFRs : 
Ans :
Functional Requirements ->
Authentication of the members of the LIS.
Updating the database of the books in the library, i.e, addition of a new book or a removal of one.
Searching and browsing of books for non-members and members alike.
Issuing books to members of the system.
Returning books to the library.
Re-issuing of books by members if no previous booking is made.
Keep a check of due dates of all the issued books.
Issuing of membership.
It should be a web based application.
Authentication of librarians and providing them administrative level control on the system.

Non Functional Requirements ->
Local institute LAN based system.
Security : Encrypted storage of data like passwords.
Filtering of books based on preferences.
Availability of the system on different platforms like android and ios.
Transaction history of books and magazines should be stored.
The database should be updated after every transaction within 1 hr.
Performance : The Server would be able to perform desired tasks in a reasonable unit of time.
Scalability : The system would be scalable to support an extended number of users.
Maintainability : The system would be easy to maintain and extend. Minor modification to the system would not cause harm to the running application.


Q2) Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Scope : 
A mobile application based on artificial intelligence which recognizes and analyses the audio input from the device to inform and alert the user of the ongoing situation surrounding it. It has a speech-to-text function that converts the audio input from the mic to text for the user. It categories all types of sound into a number of categories to simplify the identification of the noise. Ihe system has low latency so as to provide real time updates.
Feature Requirements : 
It provides a speech-to-text function and visa-versa.
It provides immediate alerts on detections of key sounds.
It uses AI to recognise and improve the translation quality from sound to text for easy identification.
Speech clarification and amplification of sound.
Detection of low amplitude noises.
Pairing with other bluetooth devices.
Non Functional Requirements : 
Performance : it has low latency for real time usage.
Ease of Use : The system would be user-friendly and would provide Graphical User Interface (GUI).
 Maintainability
The system would be easy to maintain and extend. Minor modification to the system would not cause harm to the running application.
Scalability : The system would be scalable to support an extended number of users.
It should support different types of language for every user.
